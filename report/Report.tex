\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5.5in,height=3in]{./pic/architecture.drawio.png}
\caption{System Architecture Diagram}
\label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:architecture} illustrates the high-level architecture of the B-LOCK system. This architecture comprises several key components: the user interface, blockchain smart contracts, and the storage backend. The user interface allows users to interact with the application, facilitating file uploads and retrieval. The blockchain smart contracts, deployed on Ethereum, handle file metadata storage and verification. The storage backend, implemented using Firebase, manages the actual file storage and retrieval. This design ensures a secure and user-friendly application where file integrity and ownership are maintained through blockchain technology.
\section{Decomposition Description}
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.7in,height=4in]{./pic/flowchart.png}
\caption{Flow chart}
\label{fig:flowchart}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:flowchart} presents a decomposition diagram (or a flow chart) of the B-LOCK system. This diagram breaks down the system into its core modules: user authentication, file upload, blockchain integration, and data retrieval. Each module is responsible for specific functionalities:
\begin{itemize}
   \item \textbf{User Authentication:} Manages user sign-in and sign-up, including email verification and session management.
   \item \textbf{File Upload:} Handles file selection, uploading to Firebase Storage, and associating file metadata with the blockchain.
   \item \textbf{Blockchain Integration:} Interacts with Ethereum smart contracts to store and retrieve file hashes and metadata.
   \item \textbf{Data Retrieval:} Provides mechanisms for users to access their uploaded files and associated data.
\end{itemize}


\section{Data Flow Design}

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.7]{./pic/dataflow.png}
\caption{Dataflow Diagram}
\label{fig:dataflow}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:dataflow} depicts the data flow within the B-LOCK application. The diagram illustrates the process from file upload to storage and retrieval. When a user uploads a file, the file is first hashed and then uploaded to Firebase Storage. The file's metadata, including its name and hash, is sent to the Ethereum smart contract for secure storage on the blockchain. Upon successful upload, the application updates the user interface to reflect the new file and its status. During file retrieval, the application queries both Firebase and the blockchain to provide users with the necessary information and access to their files.

\section{Integration}
\par The frontend components interact with the Firebase 
backend and Ethereum blockchain to provide a seamless user 
experience. Authentication is handled via Firebase 
Authentication, ensuring that users are securely signed in. 
File uploads are managed through Firebase Storage, allowing 
users to upload and access their files easily. Metadata related 
to the files, such as names and download URLs, is stored in 
Firestore, providing quick and reliable access to file 
information. The integration with the Ethereum blockchain 
guarantees that file hashes are securely stored and verifiable, 
leveraging smart contracts to maintain the integrity and 
ownership of each file. This combination of Firebase and 
blockchain technologies ensures that the application is both 
secure and scalable, providing a robust solution for digital
 file management.
