\section{Architecture Design}
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4in,height=3in]{./pic/sjeclogo.png}
\caption{System Architecture Diagram}
\end{figure}
This Figure 5.1 illustrates a high-level overview of the audio visual speech separation system. It is important to note that the specific techniques, algorithms, and models used in each component can vary depending on the implementation approach and the requirements of the system.
\section{Decomposition Description}
\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in,height=3in]{./pic/sjeclogo.png}
\caption{Flow chart}
\end{figure}
\newpage
Figure 5.2 represent the flow chart of the proposed system. In audio visual speech separation, the goal is to decompose an audio signal containing multiple overlapping speakers into individual speech signals corresponding to each speaker. The decomposition process involves separating the desired speech signals from the background noise and other interfering sounds.

\section{Data Flow Design}
\par
The audio input undergoes pre-processing, while the visual input is processed to extract relevant cues. The pre-processed audio and processed visual data are then integrated. From the integrated representation, features are extracted. These features are utilized in the speech separation stage, where individual speech signals are separated from the mixture. Post-processing techniques are applied to enhance the quality of the separated speech signals. Finally, the individual speech signals are outputted as the result of the system. The data flow design ensures a sequential flow of operations, starting from capturing and processing the inputs, integrating the audio-visual information, extracting features, performing speech separation, applying post-processing, and generating the output. This design allows for effective processing and separation of audio visual data to obtain distinct speech signals from overlapping speakers.

\section{Audio Extraction}
\par
Audio extraction is the process of isolating and extracting the audio content from a multimedia source, such as a video file. It involves separating the audio track from the accompanying video or other elements to obtain a standalone audio file representing the sound present in the source material.

\begin{figure}[hbtp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5in,height=3in]{./pic/sjeclogo.png}
\caption{code snippet for audio extraction}
\end{figure}

\section{Speech Separation}
\par SpeechBrain is an open-source framework 

\subsection{Sepformer}
\par SepFormer is an algorithm for speech separation that utilizes self-attention mechanisms. It employs a transformer-based architecture to capture long-range dependencies and model the relationships between time-frequency points in the audio mixture, enabling the separation of multiple speech sources from the mixture.

\caption{code snippet for speech separation}
\end{figure}

\section{Speech Enhancement}
\subsection{Lite Audio Visual Speech Enhancement}
\par
Lite AVSE algorithm is used for the separation and enhancement of the speech. The system 
includes two visual data compression techniques and removes the visual feature extraction 
network from the training model, yielding better online computation efficiency. As for the audio 
features, short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is calculated of 3-second audio segments. Each 
time-frequency (TF) bin contains the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, both of 
which used as input. Power-law compression used to prevent loud audio from overwhelming soft 
audio. The same processing is applied to both the noisy signal and the clean reference signal.

\caption{code snippet for speech enhancement using LAVSE}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Spectral Subtraction}
Spectral subtraction is a technique used in audio signal processing to reduce background noise from an audio signal. It involves estimating the noise spectrum from a noisy signal and subtracting it from the noisy spectrum to enhance the desired signal. The resulting spectrum is then transformed back into the time domain to obtain a cleaner audio signal.
